House Price Prediction Project

This repository contains a comprehensive project on house price prediction using machine learning. It includes data exploration, model training, optimization, and deployment via a Streamlit application. The project aims to predict house prices based on features such as the number of rooms, location, area, and other relevant factors. Weâ€™ve employed advanced techniques, including feature selection and model optimization, to provide accurate predictions. Feel free to explore the code, datasets, and pre-trained models provided in the repository
